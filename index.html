              <p class="text-site-purple">Corporate custody remains an elusive service. Existing solutions are either prohibitively expensive Hardware Security Module (HSM) products or require a very seasoned IT department to host, manage and validate authentications for transactions. Even worse, your and your clients’ assets may be locked away offline in a mountain somewhere, making ongoing management of your portfolio difficult and unworkable. In the end, securely storing your and your clients’ private keys isn’t much help when transaction authentication does not have a sound architecture. The Vaultavo corporate custody service solution concentrates on simplicity in service delivery, combined with a unique package of end-to-end control of the asset lifecycle for all hardware involved in the eco-system.</p>

              <p class="mb-4 text-site-purple">The Vaultavo proprietary designed and manufactured card HSM is a 2U rackmount case that holds hundreds of the Vaultavo Smartcards simultaneously.</p>
              <p class="mb-4 text-site-purple">A Vaultavo Smartcard is inserted within the card HSM and authority is given to the relevant manager to perform transactions within the smartcard on the client’s behalf - the client’s digital private key is therefore never exposed to anyone.</p>
              <p class="mb-4 text-site-purple">Once the manager/client relationship ends, the client’s Vaultavo Smartcard is simply removed from the card HSM and returned to the client. The client is then satisfied that his/her digital private keys were never copied or backed-up and that the manager has no further access to his/her crypto assets. The manager also does not have the responsibility of securing a client’s digital private keys, nor the burden of the required processes and proof of destruction - hence no further liability.</p>
